Now repository consist:

1) Simple bit operations:
    * Get/Set/Flip/Clear/Check_is_set/modify_bit value of special bit
    * The methods for counting set bits: Todo: describe the ways!
    
2) Check endianess:
    * Using union
    * Just with unsigned char
    
3) Methods for swapping bytes:
    * One from c standart library
    * Using shiffting and or operator
